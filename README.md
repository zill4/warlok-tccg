# Warlok TCCG — Trading Card Chess Game in XR

Warlok is a Yu‑Gi‑Oh–inspired trading card chess game that runs on the web and in XR. Players build decks of cards and play them onto a chessboard, then control the resulting pieces using standard chess movement. The experience can be played on a normal 2D screen or projected into your environment with WebSpatial XR.
